## Step 1: Pseudocode
"Pseudocode is the bride between thinking and coding"<br><br>

### Do's:
- Use control structures
- Use proper naming convention
- Indentation and white spaces are the key
- Keep it simple
- Keep it concise

### Don't's:
- Don't make the pseudo code abstract
- Don't be too generalized

### Example Pseudocode for Tic-tac-Toe:
1. Display the empty board
2. Ask Player 1 to choose X or O
3. Loop until the game ends:
    a. Ask current player for move
    b. Check if move is valid
    c. Place the move on the board
    d. Random move by computer
    e. Check if the player has won
    f. If not, check if it's a draw
    g. If not, switch to the other player
4. Declare result (win or draw)

## Step 2:
Write your own code to implement the game of tic tac toe.
